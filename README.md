<h1>Renaming Devices (Server, Helpdesk and Client Device)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this section, I'll rename all of the Virtual Machines I've created for this project. This will make it easy to identify devices within the domain.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Walk-Through:</h2>

STEP 1 (RENAMING SERVER DEVICE): <br/>

<p align="center">The first step will be to modify the device name to something more readable and memorable. I want to rename the device as "Server2016". So, as seen in the image above, the first step will be to launch "File Explorer".</p>

<p align="center">I right-clicked on the option labelled "THIS PC" in the "File Explorer" section using my mouse. As you can see, a new set of options is now available and I choose the option labelled "PROPERTIES". This will allow me to view the device's properties and, from there, rename it.</p>

STEP 3: <br/>

<p align="center">This is the page I see after clicking "properties". As you can see, this page has plenty of information about the device, including the computer name, Windows edition, processor, RAM, and system type. In this scenario, I am interested in renaming the device. Under "computer name" options, I click "CHANGE SETTINGS" to modify the device's name.</p>

<p align="center">Here is where I can modify the device name. As you can see in the image above, I updated the name to "Server2016". After renaming, I select "OK" to complete the device renaming procedure.</p>

<p align="center">As you can see, the device was successfully renamed to "Server 2016". The changes took effect after the Virtual Machine was restarted.</p>
